# Project 1: Predicting Property Maintenance fines

  This project is about the city of Detroit where many residents have refused to pay their blight tickets so the city want to know how they can increase blight tickets compliance.
 The approach to solving this problem is to understand when & why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. In order to get this I predicted if a given blight ticket will be paid on time or not using Gradient Boosting Classifier and AUC score for evaluating the model.
 
 I did this in the Juypter Notebook in the repository. [here](https://github.com/Holarh/Work/blob/master/project1.ipynb)
